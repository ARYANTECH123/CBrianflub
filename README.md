# CBrianflub
A Brianflub compiler in C

## What is Brainflub?
Brainflub is a programming language written entirely in symbols - so that it can be used universally without language barriers.
It is super easy to lears, having only 10 symbols that give it a robust IO system.
This is a C implementation of the language.

## How do i use it?
Download the `cbf.exe` from the releases menu. 
Now, in a terminal or command prompt:
> Use `cd` to go to the folder in which `cbf.exe` is located.

> Type in the program in a single line in any text editor.

> In the command prompt, run the command `cbf filename.txt`, replacing the `filename.txt` with your file. Note that in order for the `cbf` command to work, you must be in the same directory

### Compiling cbf yourself
The code is fairly simple, and so shouln't cause problems with most compilers. I used `gcc ` from MinGW64.
